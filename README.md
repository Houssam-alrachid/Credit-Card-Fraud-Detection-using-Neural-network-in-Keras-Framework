# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Neural-network-in-Keras-Framework
Credit Card Fraud is one of the biggest issues faced governments and the amount of money involved in this is generally enormous. 

Fraud detection methods based on neural network are the most popular ones. 

In this project, we will train an *Autoencoder Neural Network*, implemented in Keras in unsupervised fashion for Anomaly Detection in credit card transaction data.
